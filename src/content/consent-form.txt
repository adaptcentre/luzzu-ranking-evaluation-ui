   <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH</strong>:</p>
<p>This experiment is focused on gaining insight on the various data quality considerations that are taken during data source selection for a digital library task. The goal is to determine whether the suggested quality measures will help participants find the right dataset based on their quality. Our research aims to validate a statistical model that identifies the key quality indicators for specific tasks. This evaluation is targeted towards library scientists (e.g. librarians, digital library metadata maintainers etc&hellip;).</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURES OF THIS STUDY</strong>:</p>
<p>In this experiment we will present the participant with three tasks. In the first task, the participant is asked to choose the quality measures that are important for a metadata creation task, followed by the identification of importance weights of the selected measures. These selected measures and weights are passed to our algorithm as feedback. These selections are also saved in a backend database in order to calculate the precision and recall of our model. Based on the participant choices, the second task consists of the participant identifying ranked datasets relevant to the task. The chosen datasets will also be stored in a backend database for evaluation purposes. The final task is similar to the second task, however, the ranking of the datasets is based on the model&rsquo;s suggested quality measures. Here, participants&rsquo; identification of relevant datasets will also be saved in the backend database. This experiment would take a maximum of 10 minutes to complete and should be taken all at once rather than broken into segments. All participants will remain completely anonymous and no personal information is required or will be recorded. There are no particular risks to participating in this experiment beyond those inherent using any internet-based computer application.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLICATION</strong>:</p>
<p>The results of the experiment will be used for publications and may be utilized for future research purposes.</p>
