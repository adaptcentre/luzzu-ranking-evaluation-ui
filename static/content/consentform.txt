   <p class="font-weight-bold">BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH:</p>
   <p>  
      This experiment is focused on gaining insight on the various data quality considerations that are taken during data source selection for a digital library task. The goal is to determine whether the suggested quality measures will help participants find the right dataset based on their quality. Our research aims to validate a statistical model that identifies the Key Quality Indicators for specific tasks.
   </p>
   <p class="font-weight-bold">PROCEDURES OF THIS STUDY:</p>
   <p> 
      In this experiment we will present you with two questions. The first question is related to the modelâ€™s suggestion of quality measure and the second question is related to the ranking of data sources based on the suggested quality measures and quality measures identified by the participant. The answers to these questions, together with the quality measures chosen by the participant will be recorded. This experiment would take a maximum of 10 minutes to complete and should be taken all at once rather than broken into segments. All participants will remain anonymous and no personal information is required. 
      
      There are no particular risks to participating in this experiment beyond those inherent using any internet-based computer application.
   </p>
   <p class="font-weight-bold">PUBLICATION:</p>
   <p>
      The results of the experiment will be used for publications and may be utilized for future research purposes. Individual results will be aggregated anonymously and research reported on aggregate results only.
